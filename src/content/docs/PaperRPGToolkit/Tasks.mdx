title: Paper RPG Toolkit - Tasks
---
Tasks are used in PaperRPGToolkit to give tasks to custom entities.

These are added to the custom entity JSON files in their tasks array as described in the `Mobs` article.

## Task options
### Attack Nearby Players
This tells the entity to attack nearby players in a certain radius.

Heres an example:
```json
{
    "type": "attack_players",
    "detectRange": 5.0              // The range to attack players inside.
}
```

### Stay at Point
This tells the entity to stay a given point.

```json
{
    "type": "stay",
    "world": 0,                     // The dimension in which the entity should stay.  By default this is 0 or the over world.
    "location": [60.0, 40.0, 60.0]  // The location in which the entity should stay at.
}
```

### Wander Near Point
This tells the entity to wander near a given point.

```json
{
    "type": "wander",
    "world": 0,                     // The dimension in which the entity is present.  By default this is 0 or the over world.
    "location": [60.0, 40.0, 60.0], // The location in which the entity should wander near.
    "range": 10,                    // The distance in which the entity should wander in.
    "forceWhenOutOfRange": true     // Tells PaperRPGToolkit whether it should force this task to override all other tasks when the entity is out of the range given above.
}
```
