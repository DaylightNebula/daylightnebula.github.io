title: Paper RPG Toolkit - Goals
---
Goals are used by quests and dialogues to trigger when they should advance the respective quests or dialogues.

For example, if a quest wants a player to collect 10 apples, the developer can simply create a goal to require the player to get 10 apples.  This would work like this:
```json
{
  "type": "get_item",
  "item": "apple",
  "amount": 10
}
```

## Goal Types
