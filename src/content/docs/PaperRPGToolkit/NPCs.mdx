title: Paper RPG Toolkit - NPCs
---
NPCs are useful characters for your game.  They can act as quest givers or characters to fill your world.

## Creating an NPC
To create an NPC you need to create a NPC description JSON file and place it in the `npcs` folder in the `PaperRPGToolkit` folder in your servers plugin directory.
The file must contain the following:
 - `id`: A string that serves as the ID for this entity.
 - `name`: The name of your NPC that will be shown to players.
 - `type`: The entity type for your NPC.  This must be a valid vanilla entity.

Optionally, you should add a `on_click_action` which is an action that will be called when a player clicks on the NPC.

### Example
```json
{
  "id": "bob",
  "name": "Â§dBob the builder",
  "type": "VILLAGER",
  "on_click_action": {
    "type": "start_dialogue",
    "id": "bobsApples",
    "subid": "bobAskForApples"
  }
}
```

## Commands
### Spawn
`/spawnnpc <npc id> [<x> <y> <z>] [<pitch> <yaw>]`

This command spawns an NPC with the given ID.
Optionally, you may give a location to spawn the NPC, but if this is not set, your players location will be used instead.
Optionally, you may give a pitch and yaw rotation for the NPC, but if this is not set, they will be given a default pitch and yaw.

### Remove Nearby
`/removenearbynpcs [<radius>]`

This command removes nearby NPCs around your player in a radius.
Optionally, you may specify a radius to remove all the NPCs in.  By default, this will be 1 block.
