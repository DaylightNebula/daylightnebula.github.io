title: Paper RPG Toolkit - Actions
---
Actions are a simple json object that tells PaperRPGToolkit what to do when the action is run.  Actions may be given to other objects (like quests or dialogues) to be run when that object chooses.  For example, when a quest ends it can run a action that says to give the player 10 apples.

Action example:
```json
{
  "type": "give_item",
  "id": "apple",
  "amount": 10
}
```

## Action Format
An action object must always be given a type argument (a list of which can be found below).  As well as, any other arguments specified by the type.
