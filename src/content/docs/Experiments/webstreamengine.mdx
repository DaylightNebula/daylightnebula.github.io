title: Web Stream Engine
---
import { LinkCard, Card, Icon, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Web Stream Engine was a first attempt at creating an engine where the engine would download the code and all resources needed at startup or runtime instead of downloading those assets before the first launch.
The engine also took advantage of using JSON files to describe entities, levels, input and UI to design those elements and to assist in the timing the downloads for assets at runtime.
