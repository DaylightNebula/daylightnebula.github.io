import { LinkCard, Card, Icon, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A bare-bones, light-weight and cross-platform Minecraft server implementation.  Meld itself doesn't even provide the players with the ability to login to a world.  That is all provided through additional modules that are loaded by Meld.

Meld simply serves as a network interface and event system for both Java and Bedrock Minecraft.

## Modules
Meld uses modules to provide functionality to the servers.  These modules are loaded as startup and work very similarly to Spigot plugins, except with more low-level control over the server.

To create a module, you must have a class that is used to create, enable and disable modules.  This serves as the entrypoint for a module.  To do this, you must have a class that implements `MeldModule` as shown below.

```kotlin
class ExampleModule: MeldModule {
    override fun onEnable() {}
    override fun onDisable() {}
}
```

You created your first module, amazing!.  But the Meld Server does not know what to do with it.  To tell the server, you need to create a file named `module.json` in the resources directory of your module.  This JSON file needs to specify the path to the main file created above as shown below.

```json
{
    "main": "com.example.ExampleModule"
}
```

This file tells Meld to load ExampleModule as the modules main file.

### Standard Modules

There are five standard modules that can be used with Meld to add basic functionality to your server.  Heres a list of them and what they do:
| Module      | Description |
|  :-:        |-------------|
| Login       | Adds the ability to players to login to your server. |
| Entities    | Adds the ability to spawn and de-spawn entities to your server. |
| World       | Adds standard world functionality to your server. |
| Inventories | Adds standard inventory functionality to your server. |
| Player      | Adds standard player functionality to your server. |
