The Forte Engine work in progress engine designed to be a fast and light-weight render/game engine written in Rust for native and web platforms.

## Design
Forte Engine is designed around the idea of quick and light weight singleton components that integrate directly with the engine.
This allows users to add to their app without much initial impact on the engine itself.  Stock, Forte Engine comes with three components, the `LightEngine`, `EguiEngine` and `UIEngine`.
Each does exactly has their names imply.  The first allows lights to be added to a 3D app in a way that is common across components.  
The second allows you to use the Egui immediate mode UI library to make quick debugging UI.  The third allows you to easily add 2D UI to your app.

## Creating a Basic App
Use the following macro to create your app and define its components and render pass'.

```rust
create_app! {
    // the color the app will use to clear the main window with.
    CLEAR_COLOR = wgpu::Color { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 0.0 },

    // Defines the components of the engine similar to how you would with a struct.
    // Inside the brackets, place the names in the app of components that component should have access too.
    APP {
        ui_engine: UIEngine[render_engine],
        egui: EguiEngine[render_engine, inputs]
    },

    // Defines the render pass' that are needed to render your app.
    PASSES {
        // Each should be number 0 -> the number of passes you have
        0: {
            // An array that defines the parts of the render pass
            PARTS: [
                {
                    // The name of the pipeline to use to render
                    PIPELINE: "forte.ui",
                    // An array of component IDs to be called before the main render
                    PREPARE: [],
                    // Render the UI
                    RENDER: ui_engine,
                },
                {
                    // Egui doesn't need a pipeline, but one must be set anyway
                    PIPELINE: "forte.ui",
                    // Nothing needs to be prepared for Egui
                    PREPARE: [],
                    // Render the Egui
                    RENDER: egui
                }
            ],
            // Tells the app whether to use a depth buffer for this render pass
            DEPTH: true
        }
    }
}

// run the app
fn main() { run_app::<App>() }
