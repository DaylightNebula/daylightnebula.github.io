title: Nebulous Engine - Camera
---
The cameras built into the Bevy engine are amazing but lacking in some ways.  One of those ways is rendering to `Image`s, which in Bevy is quite complex, is simplified by using an `ImageCamera` component with the `BetterCameraPlugin` plugin.
Applying the `ImageCamera` to a Bevy camera will set it up so that the camera will render to a given `Handle` to a `Image`.

Heres how you can use it.
```rust
let image_camera = ImageCamera::default();
image_camera = /* Some Handle<Image> instance */
commands.spawn((
    CameraBundle::default(),
    image_camera
));
```
