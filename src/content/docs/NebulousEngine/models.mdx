title: Nebulous Engine - Models
---
The Bevy game engine's methods for handling models and animations leaves much to be desired.  The goal of this module is to fix these problems.
Both of these systems require the `GLTFPlugin` and `AnimatorPlugin` to be added to your project.

## GLTF Utilities
GLTF models are the standard, however, Bevy does not offer much control of these models.  The `GLTFModel` allows for easier animation, creates, offset and scale GLTF models.
To create a GLTF component here are a few options.
```rust
// Create a GLTF model from a path.
commands.spawn((
    TransformBundle::default(),
    VisibilityBundle::default(),
    GLTFModel::from_str(&asset_server, /* path: &str */, /* offset: Vec3 */, /* scale: Vec3 */)
));

// Create a GLTF model from Bevy's Gltf struct
commands.spawn((
    TransformBundle::default(),
    VisibilityBundle::default(),
    GLTFModel::from_str(/* gltf: Gltf */, /* offset: Vec3 */, /* scale: Vec3 */)
));
```

The `GLTFModel` component gives you a bunch tools for animation.
Here are the provided functions.
```rust
let gltf = /* Some GLTFModel instance */
gltf.set_next_animation(/* animation: &str */);             // Sets the next animation to be played
gltf.set_current_animation(/* animation: &str */);          // Sets the current animation being played
let current_anim = gltf.get_current_animation();            // Gets the current animation as an option
let current_anim = gltf.get_current_animation_as_string();  // Gets the current animation as a string, defaulting to "none"
let has_next_animation = gltf.has_next_animation();         // Returns true if this GLTFModel has a animation to play next
let has_animation = gltf.has_animation();                   // Returns true if this GLTFModel has a animation currently playing
let animations = gltf.get_animations();                     // Returns a vector containing all possible animations
```

## Animators
Sometimes, you may wish to have better control over your animations.  The `Animator` component takes care of that when applied to the same entity as a `GLTFModel`.
The `Animator` component uses a `StateMachine` to control the animations of a `GLTFModel`.  See the `Utils` page for more info.

To create an `Animator` you can do this:
```rust
let animator = Animator {
    handle: /* Handle<StateMachine> */,         // A handle to the state machine to use.
    current_animation: /* Option<String> */,    // The current animation, you can usually set this to None when creating an Animator
    triggers: /* Vec<String> */,                // The triggers currently being called on the animators state machine.  See the StateMachine documentation for more info.
    values: /* HashMap<String, f32> */          // The values currently being applied to the animators state machine.  See the StateMachine documentation for more info.
};
```

To interact with the `StateMachine` inside the `Animator`, you can use these functions:
```rust
let animator = /* An Animator instance */
animator.trigger(/* trigger: String */)                     // Calls the given trigger in the StateMachine
animator.set_value(/* name: String */, /* value: f32 */)    // Sets the value with the given name in the StateMachine
animator.get_value(/* name: String */)                      // Gets the value with the given name in the StateMachine
```
