Cubic is a work in progress mod designed to expand the possibilities of using Minecraft as a game engine by allowing mods to use custom servers (or even custom server implementations) as worlds to effectively "replace" Minecrafts core.
Since Minecraft is server authoritative, this means we can replace large amounts of Minecrafts core logic with our own logic.

Here are some examples of what may now be possible:
 - Abandon the 20 ticks per second limit imposed by Mojang.
 - Replace inefficient parts of Mojangs code like the light engine, for example (Minecraft does block light calculations on the server for some reason).
 - Make how water flows more realistic.
 - Use more efficient server implementations to save on memory and CPU resources.
 - Custom server implementations can have custom physics that would allow for things like custom vehicles, for example, without having to hack the Mojang physics engine.
 - We can write our open modding APIs from scratch and not have to abide by the mess that Mojang blesses us with.
 - Import custom assets at runtime, so if a player changes the game they are playing, we do not need to restart the client, we can just load a different set of assets.
 - Outside of the Cubic mod itself, no additional client modding would be necessary as Cubic could load any assets or resources needed by the servers.
 - These games using custom server implementations would not need Mojang mappings anymore.

## What we have
Right now, Cubic only allows players to create a new game from a template that they have already copied into cubics templates folder.  When the player starts a game, the server is started, after which the player joins the server.
The server and client both have a HTTP server that they use to communicate with each other.  They will occasionally ping each other, and when a game server starts, it tells the clients HTTP server that it is loaded and ready for the player to connect.

## What we could do
### Custom Game Mode via Custom Server Implementations
Minecraft is not set up for lots of different types of games.  

Some examples of this are:
 - A city builder would be difficult to make as stock Minecraft can only select blocks within a few meters of the player which would make managing a large city difficult.
 - A circuit builder would be difficult as stock Minecraft both capped to 20 updates per second (which could make circuits agonizingly slow), and not designed to have a signal spread more than 16 blocks in the same tick.
 - A vehicle builder would be difficult as stock Minecraft physics are not setup to, for example, handle when a vehicle impacts with the ground or have players walk around inside those vehicles while moving.

Custom server implementations can replace, rewrite or simply be put together in ways to get around all of these issues.

### Easy to use mod API that is less intrusive
No longer would we need to rely on modifying the games source code, or use Mojangs mess to create something like a new item or entity.  We could create our own simple, easy to use API that requires none of Mojangs methods, bloat or mappings.\

Since the game servers would no longer need to modify client source code to add custom features or inject themselves into the client, we can create a safer, less intrusive system for our players.\

Updating mods would also be easier as this mod API would be platform agnostic so that when Mojang updates, only the API would need an update, not the mods.
